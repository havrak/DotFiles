# Hyprland handles monitors dynamically, but swaybg needs to run continuously.
# This simply sets one image for all outputs for simplicity,
# or you can specify output (-o) for specific images.

# Simple setup: Same wallpaper everywhere
swaybg -i "$WALL1" -m fill &

# If you want distinct wallpapers per monitor like your old script:
# swaybg -o eDP-1 -i "$WALL1" -o DP-1 -i "$WALL2" -m fill &

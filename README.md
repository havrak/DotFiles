# GNU/LINUX Dotfiles

Collection of dotfiles I run on my Arch Linux Systems. I've run bspwm for years, but due to long standing bugs - floating windows spawning behind tiled windows and other have recently moved to hyprland over at wayland. However the desktop is designed to look and be controlled roughly the same. Main exception is that behavior relying on the binary tree structure of bspwm just doesn't and cannot work on hyprland.

As for neovim I've recently moved to relying on vim's own lsp integration instead of CoC.

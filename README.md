# GNU/LINUX Dotfiles

In this repository are my personal dotfiles used un my HP Elitebook 8740p, but all dotfiles should work fine across different devices. Distro I run is Antergos, but i don't think using them on any other distro would be a problem. All configs are set to use termite as default terminal emulator.

#progrmas that have configs here
+ i3-gaps
+ vim
+ powerline-shell
+ polybar
+ termite
+ bash
+ rofi


# "Dependencies" and programs used
+ light

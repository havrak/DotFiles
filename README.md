# GNU/LINUX Dotfiles

In this repository are my personal dotfiles used on my laptop and desktop (does not work out of the box for desktop, needs few changes inn configs - polybar, i3). Configs are used on Antergos, but i don't think using them on any other distro would be a problem. All configs use termite as default terminal emulator, which is hardcoded so changing $TERMINAL variable wont do much.

# Programs that have configs in this repo

+ vim
+ polybar
+ termite
+ bash
+ rofi

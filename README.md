# GNU/LINUX Dotfiles

In this repository are my personal dotfiles used on my HP Elitebook 8740p, but all dotfiles should work fine across different devices. Configs are used on Antergos, but i don't think using them on any other distro would be a problem. All configs use termite as default terminal emulator.
